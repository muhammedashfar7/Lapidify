**'Robot'** is actually a **Czech** word that means 'slave'. The word is the brainchild of the Czech playwright, novelist and journalist Karel Capek, who introduced it in his *1921* hit play, **R.U.R** or *Rossum's Universal Robots*.
It tells the story of a company that uses the latest biology, chemistry and physiology to mass produce workers who 'lack nothing but a soul'. The robots perform all the work that humans preffered not to do and soon the company is inundated with orders.
In the play's final act, the robots revolt against their human creators. In the end, two robots somehow acquire the human traits of love and compassion and go off into the sunset to make the world anew.
Audiences loved the play and soon after robots became the darling of science fiction writers. The first digital and programmable robots was created by **George Devol**.
