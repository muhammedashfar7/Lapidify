"**The Merchant of Venice** is perhaps most associated not with its titular
  hero, Antonio, but with the complex figure of the money lender, Shylock. The play
  was described as a comedy in the First Folio but its modern audiences find it more
  problematic to categorize. The vilification of Shylock 'the Jew' can be very uncomfortable
  for a post-holocaust audience and debates continue as to whether Shakespeare's portrayal
  of this complex man is sympathetic or anti-Semitic. John Drakes' comprehensive introduction
  traces the stage history of the figure of the Jew and looks boldly at twenty-first
  century issues surrounding it. He also explores other themes of the play such as
  father/daughter relations, the power of money and the forceful character of Portia,
  to offer readers an energetic, original and revelatory reading of this challenging
  play."
